alembic upgrade head
# SUCCESS: Created 23 tables ✅
```

**Installation:**
```bash
mkdir -p alembic/versions
cp 20251026_1200_0001_initial_schema.py alembic/versions/

## 🚀 Quick Start

### If You Already Have Session 17 Files:

1. **Read the review:**
   ```bash
   cat SESSION_17_REVIEW_AND_UPDATES.md
   ```

2. **Follow integration guide:**
   ```bash
   cat INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md
   # Then follow the steps
   ```

3. **Add the critical files:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p alembic/versions tests
   cp 20251026_1200_0001_initial_schema.py alembic/versions/
   cp requirements_session17.txt .
   cp acceptance_test.sh tests/
   chmod +x tests/acceptance_test.sh
   ```

4. **Deploy and test:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy_session17.sh dev
   ./tests/acceptance_test.sh
   ```

### If You're Starting Fresh:

1. **Download all Session 17 files** (original package + these 6 files)

2. **Organize directory structure:**
   ```
   session17/
   ├── alembic/
   │   ├── versions/
   │   │   └── 20251026_1200_0001_initial_schema.py
   │   ├── alembic.ini
   │   └── env.py
   ├── services/shared/db/
   ├── services/shared/auth/
   ├── tests/
   │   ├── integration/
   │   └── acceptance_test.sh
   ├── requirements_session17.txt
   ├── deploy_session17.sh
   └── [all other Session 17 files]
   ```

3. **Run deployment:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy_session17.sh dev
   ```

4. **Verify:**
   ```bash
   ./tests/acceptance_test.sh
   ```

## 🔍 Verification Commands

```bash
# Check migration file
ls -lh alembic/versions/20251026_1200_0001_initial_schema.py

# Check requirements file
wc -l requirements_session17.txt  # Should show ~100 lines

# Check test script
test -x tests/acceptance_test.sh && echo "Executable" || echo "Need chmod +x"

# Verify Alembic sees migration
alembic history  # Should show "0001 (head), Initial schema"

# Test pip install (dry run)
pip install --dry-run -r requirements_session17.txt

# Run tests
./tests/acceptance_test.sh
```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "No revision found"
```bash
# Check file exists
ls alembic/versions/*.py

# Check alembic.ini points to correct location
cat alembic.ini | grep script_location
```

### "File not found: requirements_session17.txt"
```bash
# File must be in project root
ls -l requirements_session17.txt

# Not in subdirectory
```

### "Permission denied: acceptance_test.sh"
```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x tests/acceptance_test.sh
```
