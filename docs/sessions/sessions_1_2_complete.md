- ✅ Docker Compose development environment
- ✅ Repository structure with all directories
- ✅ OpenAPI specification (see project files)
- ✅ CI/CD GitHub Actions workflows

**Session 2 Deliverables:**
- ✅ Pydantic schemas (50+ validators)
- ✅ Object storage handlers (HDF5, CSV, JCAMP-DX, NPZ)
- ✅ Unit handling system with Pint
- ✅ Test data generators for 9+ methods
- ✅ Factory functions for fixtures
- ✅ Alembic migration system
