### Secondary Stakeholders

- External Auditors (ISO, regulatory)
- Equipment Vendors (driver integration support)
- Executive Management (ROI oversight)

-----

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**

- Data scattered across 12+ vendor-specific software packages
- Manual data transcription → 10% error rate
- No centralized SPC or trending
- Difficult to correlate results across methods
- Compliance documentation takes 4-8 hours per audit
- Adding new instrument takes 2-4 weeks of IT effort

**Pain Points:**

1. **Data Silos:** Cannot easily compare IV characteristics with XRD phase data for same sample
1. **Error-Prone:** Manual copy-paste from instrument to spreadsheet to report
1. **Limited Analytics:** No ML-driven anomaly detection; defects discovered late
1. **Compliance Burden:** Auditors require paper trails; digital provenance lacking
1. **Scalability:** Adding 10 new instruments would overwhelm current process

**Impact:**

- Lost productivity: ~$400K/year (engineering time on data wrangling)
- Quality escapes: ~2% of devices fail post-characterization
- Delayed time-to-market: 3-6 weeks added to development cycles

-----

## Vision & Goals

### Vision Statement

*“A unified platform where every measurement—from resistivity to atomic composition—is automatically analyzed, quality-controlled, and traced, empowering engineers to focus on innovation rather than data wrangling.”*

### Goals (SMART)

1. **G1:** Integrate 20 characterization methods across 4 categories by end of Phase 5 (Week 16)
1. **G2:** Achieve <1% failed run rate (excluding sample quality issues) within 3 months post-deployment
1. **G3:** Reduce average time from sample to approved report from 8 hours to <2 hours
1. **G4:** Enable 100% traceability for all runs (sample → instrument → operator → result → approval)
1. **G5:** Provide SPC dashboards with <5-minute data latency for real-time quality monitoring
1. **G6:** Support virtual metrology (VM) models with R² > 0.85 for thickness, resistivity, and roughness

### Non-Goals (Out of Scope for v1.0)

- Full MES/ERP integration (basic export hooks only)
- Advanced process control (APC) for equipment (VM predictions only)
- Direct equipment control for hazardous processes (safety interlocks via separate system)
- Mobile app (web responsive only)
- Multi-site federated analytics (single-site deployment)

## User Stories & Use Cases

### User Persona: Lab Technician (Maria)

**Background:** 3 years experience, chemistry degree, operates 5 different instruments daily.  
**Goals:** Complete 20+ measurements per day, minimize errors, meet shift quotas.  
**Pain Points:** Switching between 5 different software interfaces, manual data entry, unclear error messages.

#### Use Case 1: Run Solar Cell I-V Characterization

**Actor:** Maria (Technician)  
**Preconditions:** Solar cell mounted, contacts verified, instrument calibrated  
**Flow:**

1. Maria logs into SemiconductorLab and navigates to “New Experiment”
1. Selects “Solar Cell I-V” template from method library
1. Scans barcode on solar cell sample → system auto-fills sample metadata
1. Reviews pre-run checklist (illumination source ON, compliance limits set)
1. Clicks “Start” → system performs sweep, displays live I-V curve
1. System auto-calculates Jsc, Voc, FF, efficiency → flags if out-of-spec
1. Maria reviews results, adds note (“Cell showed slight edge damage”), approves
1. PDF report auto-generated and saved to sample record

**Success Criteria:**

- Total time: <10 minutes (vs. 30 minutes manual)
- Zero transcription errors
- Report includes all required metadata for audit

-----

### User Persona: Process Engineer (David)

**Background:** PhD in materials science, 10 years experience, evaluates process changes.  
**Goals:** Correlate characterization data across methods, identify root causes, optimize processes.  
**Pain Points:** Data in silos, manual correlation, lack of SPC, reactive troubleshooting.

#### Use Case 2: Investigate Mobility Degradation

**Actor:** David (Engineer)  
**Preconditions:** SPC alert triggered (Hall mobility trending down over 10 wafers)  
**Flow:**

1. David receives email alert with link to SPC chart
1. Clicks through to see mobility X-bar chart with 7 points below centerline
1. Drills down to affected wafers → sees they all came from Furnace B
1. Queries related measurements: XPS shows increased oxygen at interface
1. Cross-references equipment logs: Furnace B had vacuum leak during affected runs
1. Uses VM studio to predict future mobility based on XPS O-concentration
1. Adds root cause and corrective action to ELN, links to all affected runs
1. Exports analysis package for management review

**Success Criteria:**

- Root cause identified in <2 hours (vs. 2 days manual)
- Data correlation automated (XPS + Hall + equipment logs)
- Preventive action (VM model flags future issues before mobility measured)
